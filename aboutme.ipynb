        "In my limited experience with R, I had the privilege of collaborating with Dr. Pejman Rohani and Dr. Christian Gunnings on data cleaning, particularly with pertussis vaccination records provided by the CDC. Using basic functions like dplyr and readr, I've had to opportunity to clean and analyze fixed width format (FWF) data files and prepare it for analysis. This valuable experience provided me with insights into the complexities of working with public health data and reinforced my commitment to learning and refining my skills in data manipulation with R.\n",
