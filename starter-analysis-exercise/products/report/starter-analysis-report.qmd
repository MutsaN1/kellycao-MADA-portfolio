# Summary/Abstract
The following project was performed in three separate parts in collaboration with Erick Mollinedo. Part 1 involved producing the data set of interest. In this case, it was a data set that showed demographic information of people, such as height, weight, gender, income, and education level. Part 2 was performed by Erick, which involved processing and cleaning the data set. The last part involves analyzing the data using linear models.

# Introduction 

## General Background Information
The analysis is performed for practice and education purpose. A theorized, messy data set is provided, and a collaboration is performed to process, clean, and analyze the data set using R and Rstudio. 

## Description of data and data source
The data is provided in a .xlsx file, which contain demographic information on 14 different individual. The demographic information include: height, weight, gender, income, and education level. 

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
What type of analysis can be performed? What can be determined when a linear model is applied to this dataset?

# Methods 
Part 1: 
The data set provided for the course is provided in a template from Andreas Handel (https://github.com/andreashandel/online-portfolio-template). The data was manually changed to provide two new categories to the data set. The two new categories added were: income and education level. The data set can be found in the folder  [/kellycao-MADA-portfolio/starter-analysis-excercise/data/raw-data/exampledata2.xlsx](https://github.com/kcao1199/kellycao-MADA-portfolio/tree/main) in the github. 

Part 2: 
The data set was processed and cleaned by Erick Mollinedo. The data was loaded and read with the package 'readx1'. The codebook was looked at with the same package. The following used the package 'skimr' to assist in visualizing summary reading. 

When cleaning the data, the package 'dplyer' was used to mutate the incorrect data "sixty" into a numeric form in the height category. It was also used to remove the data from the person providing "6," as the data provided for it had uncertainty. The person providing the weight value "7000" was also removed. The gender category was changed from character to categorical. In addition, Erick made changes to the added columns, by renaming "Income" to "Household Income" and "Education" to "Education Level." 

He then saved the data to [/kellycao-MADA-portfolio/starter-analysis-excercise/data/processed-data/processeddata2.rds](https://github.com/kcao1199/kellycao-MADA-portfolio/tree/main/starter-analysis-exercise/data/processed-data) in the github. 

Part 3: 
A statiscal analysis is performed with the lm() function. he statistical analysis was performed with a linear model fit between height as the outcome and the two new variables "Household Income" and "Education Level." The result of the linear model fit is placed on a table with the tidyverse package. The table is then saved as ["resulttable3.rds"](https://github.com/kcao1199/kellycao-MADA-portfolio/tree/main/starter-analysis-exercise/results/tables-files) in the github. 


## Data aquisition
The data is initially provided by Andreas Handel for the Spring 2024 MADA course. The data is then manipulated by Kelly Cao in part 1.

# Results
## Figures and Tables
 @fig-result1 shows a boxplot of the height of the individuals stratified by the education of the individual

```{r}
#| label: fig-result1
#| fig-cap: "Figure showing the heights of the individual stratified by their education level: Associate Degree (AD), Bachelor's Degree (BD), Graduate/PRofessional Degree (GD), High School/GED (HS), Some College but no degree (SoCo), and Vocational Training (VT)."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","height-education.png"))
```

@fig-result2 shows a scatterplot of the weight of the individuals stratified by the income of the individual
```{r}
#| label: fig-result2
#| fig-cap: "Figure showing the weigth of the individual stratified by the income of the individual in USD."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","income-weight.png"))
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable3
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table using height as outcome, Household income and Education Level as predictor."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable3 = readRDS(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","tables-files","resulttable3.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable3)
```



The code used to perform the linear fit analysis is shown below. 

```{r}
#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.
library(ggplot2) #for plotting
library(broom) #for cleaning up output from lm()
library(here) #for data loading/saving

#path to data
#note the use of the here() package and not absolute paths
data_location <- here::here("starter-analysis-exercise","data","processed-data","processeddata2.rds")

#load data. 
mydata <- readRDS(data_location)

# fit linear model using height as outcome, Household income and Education Level as predictor
lmfit3 <- lm(Height ~ `Income` + `Education`, mydata)

# place results from fit into a data frame with the tidy function
lmtable3 <- broom::tidy(lmfit3)

#look at fit results
print(lmtable3)

# save fit results table  
table_file3 = here("starter-analysis-exercise","results", "tables-files", "resulttable3.rds")
saveRDS(lmtable3, file = table_file3)
```



## Full analysis and Conclusion
It appears that the individuals with the graduate degree showed the greatest variation in height in accordance to Figure 1. In the other education level, there is little variation in height. As for the comparison between income and weight, there appears to be little correlation between the two variables. Despite that, there is a slight negative relation between income and weight when showing a line of best fit. 

In Table 1, the intercept provided an extremely high p=value, thus showing that the income and education variable affecting the height can not be proven or concluded.
